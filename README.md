I created a personal portfolio website using Tailwind CSS, React, Next.js, and Framer Motion to showcase my professional journey and technical skills. The site features a modern, responsive design with a sleek interface, thanks to Tailwind CSS, and utilizes React for efficient, component-based architecture. Next.js enhances the website with server-side rendering and static site generation, ensuring optimal performance and SEO. Framer Motion adds smooth, captivating animations for an interactive user experience. The portfolio includes a home page with a welcoming hero section, an "About Me" section detailing my background and skills, a "Projects" section showcasing key projects with descriptions and links, an "Experience" section highlighting my professional timeline, and a contact form for easy communication. The website is fully responsive, providing a consistent experience across all devices, and benefits from fast loading times. Its primary goal is to present a comprehensive overview of my capabilities to potential employers, collaborators, and clients, serving as a central hub for my work and demonstrating my proficiency in modern web development technologies.
