## Personal-Portfolio

I created a personal portfolio website using Tailwind CSS, React, Next.js, and Framer Motion to showcase my skills. The site features a modern, responsive design, smooth animations, and efficient architecture. It includes sections for my bio, projects, experience, and contact information. Optimized for performance and SEO, it highlights my web development expertise for potential employers and clients.
